# Catwork
A rather old and probably broken version of Clockwork that TeslaCloud Studios (Luna, AleXXX_007 and others) used to maintain.

Original code was written by [Conna Wiles](https://github.com/kurozael), [Alexander Grist-Hucker](https://github.com/alexgrist) and [Igor Radovanovic](https://github.com/impulsh), with contributions from the Cloud Sixteen community, credits for which [you may find in the original repository of Clockwork](https://github.com/CloudSixteen/Clockwork).

This code is probably broken. Use at your own risk.
